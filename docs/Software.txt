Installing virtual com ports

However let’s try socat:
Installation on Ubuntu 
To install socat on Ubuntu (I'm using 12.04) just run the following command:
	# sudo apt-get install socat
Open a terminal (let's call it Terminal 0) and execute it:
	socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
	socat PTY,link=/dev/ttyS0,raw,echo=0,crnl PTY,link=/dev/ttyS1,raw,echo=0,crnl
	chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS0
	chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS1
The code above returns:
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N PTY is /dev/pts/2
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N PTY is /dev/pts/3
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N starting data transfer loop with FDs [3,3] and [5,5]
Open another terminal and write (Terminal 1):
cat < /dev/pts/2
this command's port name can be changed according to the pc. it's depends on the previous output.
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N PTY is /dev/pts/**2**
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N PTY is /dev/pts/**3**
	2013/11/01 13:47:27 socat[2506] N starting data transfer loop with FDs 
you should use the number available on highlighted area.
Open another terminal and write (Terminal 2):
echo "Test" > /dev/pts/3
Now back to Terminal 1 and you'll see the string "Test".

Use socat init to deamonize:

INSTALLATION

Installtion steps are so easy just do the follwoing :

    Clone socat-init to your home directory

    $: git clone https://github.com/asaif/socat-init.git /home/$user

    Copy the files to the right path

    sudo cp -a /home/$user/socat-init/socat /etc/init.d/
    sudo cp -a /home/$user/socat-init/defaults/socat.conf /etc/default/

Now socat-init has been installed and is ready to be used. Restart system just in case.
Usage

Enter the desired socat command in socat.conf.
You can use socat-init like any other init file by excuting socat tool and pass the desired action, for example:

To see the help just execute the tool without any actions.
